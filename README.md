# Rectangular-Loop

In this repository you find the CAD data of the Rectangular Loop seperated in substrate and conductors.

Materials: 

- Conductor: PEC
- Substrate: FR-4(lossy), epsilon=4.3, loss tangent=0.025 at 10GHz (constant fit) or conductivity=0.009S/m at 297.2MHz, thermal conductivity=0.3

Comments:
- the distributed caps have the same capacitance as the tuning capacitor
